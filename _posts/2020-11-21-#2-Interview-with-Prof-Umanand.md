Hosts: Prof Abhijit Kshirsagar, IIT Dharwad and Dr. Lalit Patnaik, CERN
Geneva

Sounds expert: Prof Sudharshan Kaarthik, IIST Trivandrum

-   Undergraduate education (BE i.e. Bachelor of Engineering)

    -   Electronics and communication engineering

    -   Using discrete, and then integrated devices, to build transmitters and receivers (ham radio)

    -   Fear of power electronics: SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier) waveforms

-   Masters’ degree

    -   Electronics Design and Technology, IISc, Bangalore

    -   Impact of a great teacher on getting attracted to power electronics: Prof Ramesh Bhat

-   Areas of present interests: power conversion, DC/DC converters,
    DC/AC converters (inverters), renewable energy, photovoltaics (PV),
    motor drives, electric vehicles (EV)
-   Typical power electronics course at DESE: 2 hours/week theory, &gt;3
    hours/week lab
-   “It is difficult to draw a demarcation line between implementation
    and research. They are highly coupled, intermingled.”
-   Masters’ students typically take up closed-form projects that are
    implementation-oriented and time bound.
-   PhD (research) students typically take up open-ended problems where
    the end-time is not always fixed.
-   Promoting interaction between masters and PhD students through
    overlap in projects.
-   Solar desalination project by Dr. Ravinder Kumar

    -   Problem with earlier approach: Membrane-based desalination needs frequent replacement of membranes.

    -   Proposed solution: Increase flow rate of distilled water using two-stage distillation and pressure modulation to reduce boiling point of water.

    -   Modeling of thermal systems using bond graphs.

-   Two domains of knowledge:

    -   Physics: Dealing with the inanimate

    -   Life sciences: Dealing with the animate

    -   “If you look at physics as the mother of all the inanimates, you are domain-free, you lose the fear of domains. That is what an engineer should do.”

-   [*Bond graphs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_graph) vs block
    diagrams: Thinking in terms of energy transfer, effort variable,
    flow variable, input impedance, feedback effect, across multiple
    engineering domains.

    -   Introductory lecture on bond graphs by Prof Soumitro Banerjee,  IIT Kharagpur [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9VZ3ONMqJs*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9VZ3ONMqJs)

-   Solar cooking project by Dr. Prasanna UR

    -   Very low flow-rate meter

    -   Current control in the electrical domain transformed to  mechanical domain using bond graphs.

            null-deflection mass flow measurement by a pressure
            compensation technique,” *Flow Measurement and
            Instrumentation*, vol. 21(1), pp. 54-61, 2010. URL:

            method thereof”, Indian patent application number:

-   Big challenge for next few decades: Prime mover (or electric motor)
    design for e-mobility*—*cars, individual transport, 2/3/4 wheelers,
    locomotives.

    -   “Permanent magnet (PM) machines, such as the permanent magnet  synchronous machine (PMSM), are not the solution. There is  only one country which has monopoly on rare-earth PM  materials.”

    -   Non-PM machines will gain importance: synchronous reluctance  machines (SRM) with mechanical as well as virtual salient  poles, electromagnetic synchronous machines using rotating  transformers (non-contact, no slip rings, no brushes).

    -   Our systems will move more towards automation and robots.

-   Energy storage:

    -   Li-ion batteries: popular technology today, high energy density  and power density, but limited life.

    -   Ni-ion batteries: potential to form the backbone (large energy  storage) for the electrical grid in presence of intermittent  and distributed renewable energy sources. Long life of 15-20  years.

    -   Thermal power companies in India (E.g. [*Neyveli  Lignite*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLC_India_Limited) and  [*NTPC*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTPC_Limited)) which  are traditionally coal-based could soon be shifting to  renewable energy (wind and PV) with large energy storage.

-   Advice to bachelors’ students in electrical and electronics
    engineering: “Focus on implementation. Understand the working of
    circuits, beyond just passing exams. They should be able to build
    interfaces. Basically electronics is nothing but building
    interfaces. On the left hand side, you have something, and on the
    right hand side, you have something \[else\]. In between them, you
    are building an electronic gadget to interface the left to the
    right. It could be analog, digital, signal, power...”
-   “A PhD is a kind of meditation, a deep contemplation, it is not just
    a degree. The output of the PhD process is the mind of the person,
    the thesis is the vehicle, papers are spin-offs.”
-   On publications: “Knowledge is for sharing. It is the only thing
    which increases within you when stolen. Publish your work in
    whatever way possible, the freer the better. Unfortunately,
    publications have become a number counting mechanism for career
    development.”
