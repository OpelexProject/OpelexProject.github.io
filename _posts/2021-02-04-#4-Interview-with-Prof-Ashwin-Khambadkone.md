3. Change in Air Pollution levels due to Coronavirus
[(Article from Science Daily)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200511124444.htm)
4. Renewable Energy Sources are non-dispachable
5. Traditional power system:
  * Generation follows variation in demand for Power Balance
  * RES are both variable and uncertain
  * Data Analytics, Data Mining, Big Data etc have a lot of potential in providing some prediction and addressing uncertainity.
7. Non-Technology based solutions:
  *  behavioral changes
  *  Time-of-use pricing for EV charging
  *  “Inconvence fee / factor”: Many regions have some form of demand based pricing for use
of cars, ([*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion\_pricing*](https://n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing)) e.g. London ([*https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge*](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge)) and Singapore.
8. Problems need to be solved beyond purely from technology-basis
9. Need to keep in mind the humans interacting with the system and the behavioural aspects of these interactions.
10. More choice is not always necessary:
  * e.g. stock market investing is “automated”
  * Not just an electronic solution – a system solution
11. Evolution of technology solutions:
  -  Old systems relied on “muscle” power and had heavy user
interaction
  -  Evolved into energy self sufficiency
  - Evolving into control self sufficiency
12. Old way of doing engineering is changing – need to be aware of and
understand the entire system
13. “Making engineering more interesting”
14. How should students of today prepare themselves for the challenges
of complex-system thinking in modern jobs?
15. First year curriculum re-design:
16. Phasor representations
  - Harmonics cannot be shown in conventional phasor diagrams
  - Ask questions and connect the dots: link it to your own
experience
  - Systems thinking: Universal input voltage range
17. How to ask questions the smart way. Prioritize your questions – we
are in an information rich world
18. How to find answers
  - IEEE Spectrum, Electronics Magazines (Bodo, etc) How stuff
works.com
  - Websites of manufacturers
  - Youtube teardown sites
  - AmpHour Forum
  - Electronics Stackexchange
  - Electronics Reddit, r/AskEngineering
19. Get a layman’s understanding: “You do not really understand something unless you can explain
it to your grandmother.” this quote has been attributed to a
number of people, not sure of actual origin
20. Industry projects:
  - The most important thing is to understand what the customer
needs
  - Its not always about just taking the best algorithm
  - You need to consider things which no standard textbook will
teach, e.g. current limit as a function of thermal loading of
devices
  - The system you develop should not require a PhD to operate!
  - Run the system for an entire day!

21. Problem definition is key!
22. Multidisciplinary Approach
23. The chase of a “Novel Idea”
24. Closing remarks:
  - Identify your priorities first!
