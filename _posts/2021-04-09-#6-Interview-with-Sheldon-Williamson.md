[*Google Scholar Profile*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I9aBAuQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)

**Education:**

Bachelors at [*Father Agnel's College*](http://www.frcrce.ac.in/), University of Mumbai, India.
Masters and PhD at [*Illinois Institute of Technology*](https://www.iit.edu/) (IIT), Chicago, USA.

-   Academic experience: 8 years at [*Concordia
    University*](https://www.concordia.ca/), Montreal followed by 5
    years at [*Ontario Tech University*](https://ontariotechu.ca/),
    Oshawa
-   Typical day of the professor: Meetings with graduate students and
    industry partners, administrative meetings, teaching courses, office
    hours for students, grant proposal writing
-   Courses taught over the years: Power electronics, Advanced power
    electronics, Motor drives, Advanced motor drives, Electric machines,
    Electric vehicles / Electric transportation, Electric energy storage
    systems.
-   Future plan on teaching side: Developing a program in transportation
    electrification and autonomous e-mobility, including all the core
    power electronics courses, and also courses on control systems,
    electric machine design.
-   Emailing North American professors for grad studies:
	[*Prof Fang Peng*](https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/fzpeng), Michigan
    State University, [*Prof Ali
    Emadi*](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece/people/faculty/ali-emadi),
    IIT Chicago (now with McMaster University).
-   First Discovery Grant (5 years): Research on powertrain efficiency
    in hybrid electric vehicles.
-   Present areas of interest: EV charging, Photovoltaics (PV) for
    charging, Wireless charging, Battery Management Systems (BMS),
    Traction and electric motor drives
-   Graduate students who worked on wireless charging: [*Dr. Kunwar Aditya*](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/kunwaraditya), [*Deepak Rozario*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak-rozario-6bb68479),
    [*Dr. Deepa Vincent*](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/deepa-vincent-88789b96), [*Dr.
    Phuoc Sang
    Huynh*](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/phuoc-sang-huynh-17563a12b).
-   "Engineering research means nothing if it does not produce a product
    at the end of the tunnel. We are engineers, not scientists."
-   Importance of developing products in collaboration with industry
-   Industrial collaborators: [*TM4*](https://www.danatm4.com/),
    [*Opal-RT*](https://www.opal-rt.com/),
    [*InMotive*](https://www.inmotive.com/),
    [*Linamar*](https://linamar.com/), [*D&V
    Electronics*](https://www.dvelectronics.com/)
-   "The most fruitful part of engineering research \[in academia\] is
    when you see your work being used in the industry. That is an
    indicator of the impact of your research."
-   Looking into the future: "Mobility will completely change. Plugged
    charging needs human intervention, and hence will have to be
    replaced by wireless charging."
-   Problems in adoption of wireless charging: Standard are not yet
    mature, power levels need to be scaled up, social acceptance
    especially with regard to concerns for health effects of the
    electromagnetic radiation.
-   Incoming research students: They already have 60%
    of the skills and learn the remaining 40% through experimentation
    and failures. One of the key skills is to be able to design a system
    to specifications.
-   Revamping of the electrical engineering syllabi and programs is a
    priority especially in India as many of the curriculums are stuck at
    older times. New programs required in smart grids and transportation
    electrification.
-   Big challenges in the next few decades: autonomous mobility (land,
    air, sea), vehicle-to-vehicle charging, cybersecurity of power
    electronic systems.
