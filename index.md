The Opelex Project brings the "open" philosophies of open-source, open-hardware and free software to the arena of Power Electronics and allied fields. It includes a wide variety of [sub-projects](https://gitlab.com/opelexnet) spanning hardware designs (schematics, netlists, board layouts and gerbers), simulation models and libraries (largely ngSPICE and MATLAB based), documentation tools, and much more.

The Opelex Project was born in the Power Electronics Group at the Center for Electronics Design Technology (CEDT) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore. In early 2020, we began work on a new [podcast](/podcast) which was launched in October 2020.

#### Components
The Opelex Project consists of code (available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/opelexnet)), accompanied by a [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/opelexnet/docs/opelexwiki/-/wikis/home). Wiki editing rights are currently limited to the core team only, but we welcome suggestions through pull requests via gitlab. The opelex podcast, released monthly, currently contains interviews with leading experts in the field of Power Electronics.
