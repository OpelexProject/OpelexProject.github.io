The Opelex Project brings the "open" philosophies of open-source, open-hardware and free software to the arena of Power Electronics and allied fields. It includes a wide variety of sub-projects spanning hardware designs (schematics, netlists, board layouts and gerbers), simulation models and libraries (largely ngSPICE and MATLAB based), documentation tools, and much more. The Opelex Project was born in the Power Electronics Group at CEDT, IISc. In early 2020, we began work on a new podcast which was released in late 2020.

#### Components
The Opelex Project consists of code (largely stored in git repositories on GitLab), accompanied by a Wiki.
Currently Wiki editing is limited to the core team only. The opelex podcast, released monthly, currently contains interviews with leading experts in the field of Power Electronics.
